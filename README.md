## Hi there, I am Meera! 👋

Nice to meet you! I'm currently a rising senior at **San José State University (SJSU)** majoring in **Computer Science**.  

💻 **Summer 2025:** I interned at **HPE as a Data Engineer**, working with **Python, SQL, and Snowflake**.  

📚 I'm currently learning **AI/ML** through a course by **Cornell University**, supported by **Break Through Tech**.  

💻 I got matched with **Automation Anywhere** for my **AI studio project** this fall, the project mainly focuses on Data Extraction and Visualization. 

🔎 I'm looking forward to joining a **research opportunity** and would love to collaborate on AI/ML/DS-related projects, as I find them fascinating!
